            <p class="lead">Version control is the process of having a single repository that all the files in a business or group is set to be saved on.  Individuals will then access the system, check out files in order to update them and then put them back in the system when they are finished. The process or putting the files back is called “committing.” With version control you can go back to an older saved files which helps especially for graphic designers and web designers. This way previous files are not overwritten if there is an error in the new version of the file.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control systems are the databases that utilize version control. They automatically note who has gone into the system to change files. They also note where, when and how each file was updated. Version control systems benefit from the fact that files cannot be overwritten, the most recent files are conveniently held in the common repository. Even when using a version control system with only one person, they are extremely useful because they keep backup files so that you never have to start from scratch or lose work. Version control systems use either local or remote repositories. Remote repositories are shared among many users, while local repositories stay on a single device.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Centralized version control systems were developed so every person involved in a project could interact and update their files. CVCS’s use a single server to host all of the files. The clients then access this server to “check out” files, update them and save to a new version. This provides a greater ease of communication because all users know exactly how much every other user has progressed. There are several downsides to this method. Having a centralized server means that there is a single point of failure that could affect everyone on the system. If the server crashes, that is lost time where nobody can commit a file. Additionally, if the hard drive of the server gets corrupted, there is a possibility to lose all the work stored if it is not backed up properly.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Distributed version control systems, like GIT, are becoming increasingly popular. Each user gets their own copy of the repository on their device. This means that you get the advantage of having a remote repository while still being able to work offline like with the local repository. Because it utilizes both aspects, it is much faster, efficient and nearly impossible to lose work. Distributed version control systems also allow the user to collaborate with multiple users in different ways on the same project. This is because DVCS’s “mirror” what the centralized VCS contains on each device. Improvements in computing power have allowed these systems to be increasingly reliable and powerful..</p>

            <p class="lead">Some basic GIT commands allow the user to alter the file path and information in the distributed version control system. The “git commit” is an important command because it adds the file to commit. The “git branch name” command will create a new branch called name. Each branch you create can later be deleted with the command “git branch delete –name.” The primary use of the command “git checkout” is to switch between branches quickly by typing the name of the branch or individual commit after “checkout.” You can combine “git branch” and “git checkout” with “git –b checkout branch-name” this creates a new branch and automatically checks it out.</p>
