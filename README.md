## Project Description:
This assignment had us link our GIT accounts to Cloud9 and then describe 5 topics that we learned. I described Version Control, Version Control Systems, Centralized Version Control, Distributed Version Control and GIT Basics.

## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. I learned about version control systems which are databases that allow a project to be accessed by multiple people and keep previous versions of files.
2. I learned the basics of GIT including commands to commit and delete files and to create new branches.
3. I learned the difference between centralized, local and distributed version control systems which each have their own advantages and disadvantages.
